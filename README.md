## Prerequisites

In order to run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

## Installation

### Backend

To install the necessary Python packages, run the following command in the project root directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Frontend

To install the necessary Node.js packages, run the following command in the `frontBuild` directory:

npm install

or

yarn install

## Usage

To start the Django development server, run the following command in the project root directory:

python manage.py runserver

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000/.

To build the React frontend, run the following command in the `build` directory:
